/**
 * SCORM tracking helpers shared between the `track.php` endpoint and its tests.
 *
 * Holds the per-iDevice routing logic so it can be unit-tested without invoking
 * the AJAX script. Two concerns live here:
 *
 *  - {@see self::parse_suspend_data()} decodes eXeLearning's `cmi.suspend_data`
 *    string — both the versioned `exe12/` payload written by the SCORM 1.2 runtime
 *    and the legacy unversioned lines. It is the single PHP source of truth for both
 *    formats and mirrors the JavaScript parser in the `view.php` SCORM shim.
 *  - {@see self::apply_item_scores()} routes per-iDevice scores to the gradebook by
 *    the stable `objectid` captured client-side (DEC-5-01 / RIE-007), instead of by
 *    the page-local index N the producer emits — which collides across pages.

     *
     *  - the VERSIONED payload `exe12/1|{record}|{record}…` written by eXeLearning's
     *    SCORM 1.2 runtime (core PR #2209 onwards, see

     *    names its own activity id, so entries come back keyed by that stable
     *    objectid and route straight through {@see self::apply_item_scores()};
     *  - the LEGACY unversioned lines `{N}. "{title}"; {scoreLabel}: {S}%;
     *    {weightLabel}: {W}%` joined by ".\t", written by every earlier release. N is
     *    the page-local DOM index of the iDevice (NOT our itemnumber, and it collides
     *    across pages; see DEC-5-01), so entries come back keyed by N and only the
     *    client shim — which can see the loaded page — can resolve them safely.
     *
     * One representation serves both: each value carries `title`, `scorepct` and
     * `weighted`, plus an `objectid` key on — and only on — an entry that knows its
     * own identity. Callers branch on that key, never on the raw string. This mirrors
