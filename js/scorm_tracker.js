 * SCORM 1.2 tracker for the eXeLearning player (single source of truth).

 * This module is the grade-critical client side of the activity. view.php reads
 * this file and injects it inline (NOT as an AMD module) so window.API exists
 * synchronously before the package iframe's pipwerks findAPI() runs — an async
 * AMD load would race the SCO and break grading. The same file is unit-tested
 * with Vitest (tests/js/scorm_tracker.test.js); the parsing logic mirrors the
 * PHP parser \mod_exelearning\local\track::parse_suspend_data so both stay aligned.
 *
 * It is exposed two ways from a single body: window.exeScormTracker for the
 * browser bootstrap, and module.exports for the test runner.

     * From a fresh suspend_data parse, keep only the entries that changed (the iDevice

     * prev/itemScores state.
     *
     * VERSIONED (`exe12/`) entries carry their own objectid: they are matched against
     * the objectid-keyed baseline and nothing below applies — no DOM resolution, no
     * heuristics, no residual limits. Everything that follows exists solely because
     * the legacy format cannot name its owner.
     *
     * LEGACY entries name only a page-local slot N, which the producer reuses on every
     * page, and every write repeats the whole map — so the payload mixes the score
     * that just happened with stale entries from pages visited earlier. Two rules that
     * look reasonable each break one half of that:
     *
     *  - keying the change baseline by slot N drops a real grade: a page-2 iDevice
     *    whose slot already held a page-1 entry with the SAME score and weight
     *    compares equal and is never graded (trace synthetic-collided-slot-same-score);
     *  - keying it by objectid alone invents one: the stale page-1 entry resolves
     *    against page 2's DOM map, looks brand-new for that objectid and contaminates
     *    an iDevice the learner never touched (trace synthetic-stale-slot).
     *
     * The rule implemented here keeps the objectid-keyed baseline (so no grade is
     * lost) and adds an attribution test before trusting a slot resolution (so no
     * grade is invented). A legacy entry is attributed to the objectid its slot
     * resolves to unless an identical entry — same title, same score, same weight —
     * is already banked for a different objectid that the loaded page does NOT own,
     * in which case it is a carried-over copy and is ignored entirely: neither graded
     * nor banked under the wrong owner.
     *
     * Two consequences worth stating:
     *  - a slot with no live occupant (beyond the loaded page's node count, or an
     *    id-less node) never resolves at all, so it can never be attributed;
     *  - a single-page package is untouched by the attribution test, because every
     *    banked objectid is on the loaded page and the test can only ever fire
     *    against an off-page one.
     *
     * Residual limits, honestly:
     *  1. two iDevices on different pages that share a title AND score identically
     *     AND weigh the same are indistinguishable in this format; the later one is
     *     read as a carry-over and stays ungraded until its score changes. A real
     *     recorded trace shows repeated titles are common (four iDevices all called
     *     "Activity A"), so the score+weight half of the triple is load-bearing.
     *  2. a stale entry whose real owner was never banked — its page was scored
     *     before this LMS session began (a resumed attempt) — has nothing to match
     *     against and is still attributed to the current slot occupant.
     *  3. both disappear under `exe12/`, which is why the fix belongs in the legacy
     *     branch only and why nothing here should be generalised to the new format.
