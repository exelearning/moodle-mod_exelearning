// Real, monotonic Moodle version (YYYYMMDDXX). Never a sentinel: this value is
// part of Moodle's install/upgrade protocol and ships exactly as committed —
// packaging validates it but never rewrites it. Increment it whenever Moodle
// must detect a change (db/, classes/, JS source or builds, settings, language
// strings, tasks, capabilities, external services, other cache-sensitive
// metadata), and keep it strictly greater than the latest published version and
// every upgrade_mod_savepoint() in db/upgrade.php. The development marker lives
// in $plugin->release ('dev'); a release-preparation PR commits the final
// version + semver release BEFORE the tag is created (see DEVELOPMENT.md,
// "Versioning and releases").
